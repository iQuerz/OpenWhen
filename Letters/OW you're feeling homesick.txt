Open when you're feeling homesick

My dear Mica,
I know that being away from home can be tough on you, and I know that this isn't a foreign feeling to you. Even if I don't experience such emotions, I think it's natural to feel homesick. All the things that  Remember all the things you love about home, the people, the places, and the memories. Home is not just a place, it's a feeling. And you can always carry that feeling with you. Better yet - you can always call them and hear them in person! I bet they can't wait for you to come home and I believe that you will make it! If we really want to do something, we find a way. If we don't really want to do it, we find an excuse. You can work on your goals and create the opportunity to visit Jagodina and spend some time with Srna, Mama and Darko, and I truly believe that you are strong and capable to do so!

With all my love,
Maca
