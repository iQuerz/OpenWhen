Open when you need a good laugh / smile

My sweet angel,
I know that sometimes life can be tough, and a good laugh can go a long way. So I put together a little something to make you smile and to remind you that you are loved and appreciated. Remember to laugh, it's good for the soul. Remember that I am always here to make you laugh, to brighten your day, and to remind you that you deserve to be the happy sunshine you always are. You brighten my every day and you make my life better. I hope I can do something for you too.
