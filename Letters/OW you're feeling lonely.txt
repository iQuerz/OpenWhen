Open when you're feeling lonely

My beautiful,
I know that sometimes when we're apart, it can feel lonely. I know that when you don't have friends around you (physically or psychologically) it can feel lonely too. But I want you to know that you are never truly alone. I am here for you, in your thoughts and in your heart. Anja, Lena, Jeca & Milica have been and will be with you always. People around you are there for you and you shouldn't be afraid of hitting them up. Remember - They don't know what's inside your mind. They'll gladly talk with you, or even go out! You just have to ask!!! We all love you Mico <3 it's just... life can get a bit complicated and we get lost in our responsibilities... I'm sorry if I ever let you feel lonely :( I will certainly look out not to do that.

You are loved and you are important, my love.

Your Maca :3
