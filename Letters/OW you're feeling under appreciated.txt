Open when you're feeling under appreciated

Oh honey...
I know that it can sometimes be easy to feel underappreciated and unseen. You are loved and valued, and I see all the amazing things you do. Remember the way you care, the way you love and the way you make a difference in the lives of those around you. You are able to understand everyone's emotions and give pretty decent advices :3 you have high emotional intelligence and you're able to process your thoughts way better than most people. You can be so kind and respectful to others... Remember that you are appreciated, and your contributions are important.

I am proud of you and all that you do, and I am here to remind you of your worth. Call me and tell me about your struggles anytime you want. I will be there for you, day or night.

I know that I've done not so shiny things in the past and that I sometimes made you feel such way, but please, if I'm the reason this time, be open and tell me about it. I have learned how to intake others' emotions and I am more than willing to hear you out and more importantly feel what you feel. There's no reason to feel afraid that I won't accept your words. Please reach out, because I don't want you to suffer. You deserve only the best <3

You will always have my time and effort,
Maca
