Open when you've had a nightmare about us

My dearest Mica,
I know that sometimes you have nightmares about our relationship and it can be scary and unsettling. I want you to know that I am here for you and I am always here to listen and to support you. Remember that nightmares are not real, they are just a reflection of your fears and anxieties. Our love is real and strong, we are building a strong foundation of trust and respect. I am here for you and I will always be here for you, to listen to that bad Nikola from your nightmares and to assure you that I will never be like him. I give my word. You are my queen and you deserve nothing but respect and honesty. I made a promise to myself that I'll never hurt you the ways that I did and I will treat you like I should. I really love you with all my heart and you don't have to worry about me failing you <3

With all my love,
Maca
