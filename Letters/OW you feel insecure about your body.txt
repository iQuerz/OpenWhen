Open when you feel insecure about your body

HEY!

"Don't waste your life's purpose worrying about your body... It's your vessel, it's your house, it's where you live! There's no point in judging it."

You are beautiful as you are. You are an angel walking this earth. Everything you feel bad about your body is just your own mind playing with you... Cheer up hottie! Just ask me what I love about your and you'll get a comprehensive (and possibly a quite horny) list. And by the way, your moves are a sexy bunch too, don't forget that ;) it's not just the looks.

Though... I know that we shouldn't rely on external validation for our own feelings, and your emotions are completely valid just the way they are. I'm not trying to lessen them. The grand picture here is that we shouldn't worry about our body too much. Yes, you should be aware of your body's health, and there are a lot of ways that you can feel better! You might want to have a nice and healthy meal? Or do some yoga and/or exercises, take a nice shower and do a skincare routine, maybe even dance before that, the insecurities will fade away :3

Tell me what are you insecure about and I'll come right away to kiss them away! Wherever you say!

Lots of love for my sexy doll,
