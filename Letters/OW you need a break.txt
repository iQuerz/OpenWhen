Open when you need a break

My dear Mica,
I know that life can be demanding, and it's important to take a break and take care of yourself. Remember that you deserve to relax and recharge. Please take some time for yourself, do something you enjoy or something that makes you feel ... uhm... relaxed and fulfilled <3.
You could crochet(valjda je to heklanje) something? Make me a bracelet ðŸ˜¡. You could draw something :3 MOZES DA SPREMAS TIRAMISU or you could call me to... you know... make you feel better ;) so you can just relax and enjoy my company

Idk what were you thinking ^^ but when I said I can keep you company i definitely meant baking for you, watching a movie with you, caring after you, you know, cuddling and such...

With all my love and passion,
Maca
