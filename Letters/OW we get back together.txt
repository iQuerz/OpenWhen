Open when we get back together

Oh damn... We made it? Wow... Tell me, what date is it? I'm writing this on 18th of January, 2023., 10 days before your birthday, in the middle of my own depression and self pity, because I am really ashamed of how I treated you... I really hope that by now you recognize how much I have really changed and how much I am a different person than I was before our breakup.

What do you think about our new relationship? Have we went on a really fancy dinner in Novi Sad and I gave you a ring or something cute? Have we just talked things out really well? Did I manage to move to NS? Have you got that iPad ahahaha or is it still on its way? Do you still want it? Do you still have that keyboard that I made you a while back? Are you still using it?

Do you feel like you trust me again? Do you think that we will live together happily? Are you satisfied with yourself? Are you satisfied with our relationship?

Do you have any really good memories from our small isolation period?

Is there anything that still stings you about me to this day? I would encourage you to share those feelings with me. (I started writing how this would be the perfect moment to tell me about it, but realistically, almost every moment is good moment to talk about your feelings, and you shouldn't be scared to share them with me. Just let everythin out my dear, I will gladly listen. Remember - our emotions are a lot more important than anything else.)

Feel free to tell me about opening this letter and talk with me about all the stuff that I mentioned ^^ Ask me something along the same lines maybe?

I love you to the moon and back, my darling. You will always be in my heart. I will always love you and I will always try to make you feel loved and secure.

I let out some tears while writing this

forever yours,
Maca
