Open when you're feeling like giving up

My dearest Mica,
I know that sometimes things can get tough and it can be easy to feel like giving up. I want you to remember how far you've come and how much you've accomplished. It can really seem like it wasn't that tough when it's all behind you, right? You get a sense of pride, accomplishment, joy and peace when you get it done... You just have to push a bit more and the easy days will come, I promise. You are strong and capable, and you can get through this. You know that I am here to help you in any way I can. If you need some rest, you can always call me and chat with me. OR - maybe you can take a nap or treat yourself with some nice waffles :3. Take some time off and get back at winning! Remember all the times you've overcome obstacles before and how you've come out stronger than before! Believe in yourself and your abilities. You got this!

With all my motivation and heart,
Maca
