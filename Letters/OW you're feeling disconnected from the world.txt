Open when you're feeling disconnected from the world

Oh my lovely dissociated destiny,
I know that sometimes it can be easy to feel disconnected from the civilization, from those around you... I can understand your feelings. They come from thoughts that you're not like people on this world, and yes, I do agree. We're very different and the world is just trying to shape us into this one template of a human being that works from 9 to 5 and repeats every day on a loop. There are fucking machines of students that can just ingest books and content and be okay with it ðŸ’€ðŸ’€. I know we're not one of them. Take some time for yourself, reconnect with your passions, and remember the things that matter to you most. Count them out, re-evaluate what do you like about living here among your closest ones. Remember that we are all human, and we all have our moments. It's okay to reach out for help, and I am here to listen and to support you.

With all my love,
Maca
