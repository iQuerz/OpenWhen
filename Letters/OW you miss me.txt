Open when you miss me

My dear Mica,
I know that sometimes when we're apart, it can feel like a piece of me is missing. But please know that I am always thinking of you, no matter where I am. You are always in my thoughts and in my heart. Remember all the good times we've shared together, the inside jokes, the silly moments, the adventures we went on. Remember how we always find a way to make each other laugh, and how we're always there to support each other. I miss you too, but know that I'll be back soon, and we'll make more memories together. We will maybe go on a summer trip! Maybe have a picnic, or maybe we will plan to go to some spa center for a weekend and just enjoy each other's company! I can't wait to hold you in my arms again, and to hear all about your days when we were apart.

You know what? Just tell me you wanna go somewhere and we'll make that wish come true. Just be serious and ask me about it without underlying jokes, you'll see how i'll go manager mode, making plans n shit

I love you baby, We will get through this <3
