Open when you're feeling overwhelmed (responsibilities)

My loving Mica,
I know that sometimes life can feel overwhelming, with so many things to do and so many responsibilities to take care of. But I want you to know that you are strong and capable, and you can handle anything that comes your way. Remember to take a deep breath and focus on one thing at a time. You got this. One day at a time baby. To conquer the day you have to conquer the hour. Make a list of small tasks, sort them in order you'd like to do them, count slowly from 5 to 0 and go! Don't forget to take time for yourself, do something you enjoy, or something that makes you feel relaxed. Whether it's taking a walk around Promenada or a nearby park, listening to music, reading a book, taking a nap or even talking to me or any of your friends, make sure you're taking care of yourself. Remember that you are not alone in this, and I am always here to support you. I believe in you and I know that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. When you think about how you passed the physics exam and also earned 48+ ESPB so you don't have to pay for third year of your studies, you will realize that you were stressed and overwhelmed in those times too, but you still pulled it off. You can do it <3

With all my love and support,
Maca
