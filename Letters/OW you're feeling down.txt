Open When You're Feeling down

My dearest Mica,
I know that life can be tough at times, and it's natural to feel down. But I want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what. You are not alone. You are loved, and you are important. I know about our plan about no communication, but don't resist to call. In times like these, I will be by your side and I will provide every bit of support that I can. Please remember that, If we were always at our best, you know... we were always happy and never sad, would we be able to feel happy? Just a thought. Who knows, maybe when you open this we are already in contact and happy together, in that case, the sentence I just mentioned should have more sense :D. We learn to cherish the good times when we experience the bad times. You will get through it, I know you will! I know that you have your own struggles, but I want you to know that you are not alone in this. You are one of the strongest persons I know, and I believe in you. I believe that you can overcome anything that comes your way. Remember that I am always here to support you, to listen to you and to remind you of your own strength. Give me a call!

Lots of love,
Maca
